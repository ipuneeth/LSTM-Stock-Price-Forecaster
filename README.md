# LSTM-Stock-Price-Forecaster
This project implements a univariate LSTM neural network in TensorFlow/Keras to forecast daily stock prices using historical time-series data and sliding window preprocessing. The model demonstrates effective trend prediction, validated by RMSE and MAE metrics on a chronological hold-out dataset.
